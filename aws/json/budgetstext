why Containerization? Makes it accessible for others. Containerization cimplifies everything
You get to use an env that a pro has up and running. Even with a simple python program, put 
in a Docker file. Linuxserver.io has heaps of cont images and over time you can transition to 
these instead of building everything yourself. Look at the images, the Docker files are high
quality and follow best practices. 
If Linuxserver doesn't have an image you need, you can use theirs as a basis to build your own.
What is Docker Hub? A cont registry provided by Docker where you can host/share images. 
When others want to use your image, they just pull it. Click through Docker Hub images and see
With cont registries, there are lots to look at Docker Hub, OPI Open Cont Initiative. Docker Hub
follows the standards of registry. 
J Frog is another place to host and get images. 
Artifacts are libraries that you can use for your Docker stuff. 

Let's now write some Docker files. 
Every command in a Docker file creates a layers. Images add on layers. 
Cont use union file system. Becomes merged layers. 
Layer at bottom that creates files, delete it in higher layer and it's gone!

The host operating system is the op sys we are on. 
The guest op sys is the cont
Think of them as sep entities? Think about where the cont will work from?
You put everything in a dir called /hello. You could either have command 
change to /hello and run the app, or you can have it all run from where you are.
Open a terminal and you're in the home dir. 
 
workdir puts you in the entry point for your cont. 
Docker cont is just basically another OS. The Linux kernel is shared. The OS is another
variation of that. The
