# The purpose of this file is to allow us to run two files at the same time!
#docker file commands help with the go to structure. A compose file helps with 
#the buildfile.
#Typically in the image you can specify to use this image. 
#Docker compose helps to build up containers in parallel.
#why docker compose up and docker compose down?
#historically docker and compose were separate things you had to both install.
#They started with one syntax bc they were independent projects. 
# Now we're supposed to use the docker compose not -compose.
#kubernetes are similar in that you have a couple of ways to write it
